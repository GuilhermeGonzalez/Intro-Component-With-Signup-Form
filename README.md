## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this introductory component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## Languages :computer: 

- **HTML** 
- **CSS**
- **Javascript**
